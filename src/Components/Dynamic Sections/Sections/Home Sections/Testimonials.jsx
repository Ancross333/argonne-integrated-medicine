      review: "This is my new regular monthly stop. I can't believe how amazing my experience was, genuinely. Between the kind front desk members, to the personable and professional Docs, this office is a must. Doctor J. Goldfeldt took the time to listen to my habits, then took extra time to tend to my concerns. Doc then took a moment to explain what he was doing and how'd I'd feel going and coming out of it. I just can't believe I've never had this done before because now I can't imagine never not doing this regularly. It was extremely affordable, to the point where I'd happily pay twice as much for that level of care. If you're seeing this; I thank you, to the moon and back, for my experience. A patient for life."
